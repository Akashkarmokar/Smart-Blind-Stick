# Smart-Blind-Stick
Smart Blind Stick along with Arduino nano  to help a person to detect  the object  from a distance.

The smart stick system for assisting blind people . Visually impaired people use stick to find difficulties in detecting obstacles and danger in front of them during walking and to identify the world around .

# Materials Required : 
  1. Arduino nano .[ Here I am use version 2 of Arduino Nano ]
  2. Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04
  3. Buzzer and LED .
  4. Push Button 
  5. Voltage Regulator U1-7805
  6. 9V Battery.
  7. Stick.
  8. Other materials like : glue,tape etc........
  
 # Arduino Blind Stick in Action :
Make sure the connections are done as per the circuit diagram and the program is succesfully uploaded .Now ,power both the circuit using  a 9v battery and you should start to see results .Move the ultra sonic sensor closer to any object  and you will notice the buzzer beeping .
